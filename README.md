## Inspiration

Sometimes, when my friends visit Taipei, they always ask, "What's good to eat in Taipei?" I have to dig into my memory to recall a few places I remember and tell them. While Google Maps or Google Search are useful, they're just references based on a huge amount of data.

And there are a few issues:

* Restaurants can use marketing to get five-star reviews.
* It's hard to judge if a recommendation is genuine or a sponsored post.

Finding a restaurant is like playing minesweeper. If possible, everyone would want each meal to be worth the money. So, how can you effortlessly find good restaurants? Well, that's where "recommendations from friends" come in.

Foobars combines the functionalities of Google Maps and the Instagram community. You can invite your close friends to join in, enhance interactions with them, and when you want a change of flavor or travel to a different place, you can easily find cool bars, cafes, and restaurants nearby that your pals recommend.

有時候我朋友來台北時，總是會問台北有什麼好吃的。我總是得從我的記憶深處挖出幾個記得不錯的餐廳告訴他們。Google Map 或 Google Search 雖然好用，但是他只能當作一個大數據的參考依據。

並且充斥著幾個問題：
* 餐廳能透過行銷手段洗五星好評
* 無法判斷是否為真心推薦或是業配文

找餐廳就像是踩地雷一樣，如果可以大家都希望每一餐花了錢都能夠吃到好的。那要怎麼樣才能以最不費力的方式，又找到好吃的餐廳呢？那大概就是 “朋友推薦” 了。

Foobars 結合了 Google Map + Instagram 社群的功能，你可以找你的親朋友一起來玩，增加與朋友的互動，在你想換個口味或到異地出遊時，也可以在附近找到朋友推薦厲害的酒吧、咖啡廳、餐廳。

## Development Process

This app, from concept, design, development, to deployment, has been entirely undertaken by myself, consuming a significant amount of time. On the app side, I employed React Native and Expo, while on the backend, I utilized NestJS, TypeORM, PostgrsQL. Additionally, I employed AWS S3 Lambda to store and generate photos of various sizes. For deployment, I utilized Heroku, EAS, and also incorporated Redis to reduce latency, along with Google Place API services.
