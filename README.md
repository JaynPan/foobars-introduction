## Inspiration

Sometimes, when my friends visit Taipei, they always ask, "What's good to eat in Taipei?" I have to dig into my memory to recall a few places I remember and tell them. While Google Maps or Google Search are useful, they're just references based on a huge amount of data.

And there are a few issues:

* Restaurants can use marketing to get five-star reviews.
* It's hard to judge if a recommendation is genuine or a sponsored post.

Finding a restaurant is like playing minesweeper. If possible, everyone would want each meal to be worth the money. So, how can you effortlessly find good restaurants? Well, that's where "recommendations from friends" come in.

Foobars combines the functionalities of Google Maps and the Instagram community. You can invite your close friends to join in, enhance interactions with them, and when you want a change of flavor or travel to a different place, you can easily find cool bars, cafes, and restaurants nearby that your pals recommend.
